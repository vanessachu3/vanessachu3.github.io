            <p>
                <br>
                The LEM Current Transducer Signal Conditioning Board is a hardware design project focused on converting large AC primary currents (125&nbsp;A<sub>RMS</sub> to 3000&nbsp;A<sub>RMS</sub>) into a precise and isolated DC voltage output scaled to 10&nbsp;V full-scale.
                <br><br>
                When defining the project, the following soft requirements were established:
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Input current range: 125&nbsp;A<sub>RMS</sub> to 2000&nbsp;A<sub>RMS</sub></li>
                <li>Output voltage range: 0V to 10V DC</li>
                <li>Operating bandwidth &gt; 500kHz</li>
                <li>Total output error: ±0.05% FS</li>
                <li>High accuracy &lt; 0.1%</li>
                <li>Low-noise and low drift (&lt; 10 ppm/°C)</li>
                <li>Less number of secondary turns the better (less # of turns = lower gain to scale to 10&nbsp;V)</li>
                <li>Takes 24V input and outputs isolated +-15&nbsp;V to power LEM transducer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <br>
                A block diagram for the system is shown below:

                To begin the project, the range of measured currents must first be sorted and picked out. I decided to use the IN series due to their low-noise, high-accuracy, packaging flexibilities, and client requirements. The transducers selected are as follows:
            </p>   
                <!--<ul class="lem_models">
                    <li>IN 200-S: 200Arms, 300A peak current, 1100kHz bandwidth</li>
                    <li>IN 400-S: 400Arms, 600A peak current, 800kHz bandwidth</li>
                    <li>IN 1000-S: 1000Arms, 1500A peak current, 440kHz bandwidth</li>
                    <li>IN 2000-S: 2000Arms, 3000A peak current, 140kHz bandwidth</li>
                </ul>-->

            <p>
                Multiple LEM transducers were evaluated, each offering different tradeoffs in linearity, bandwidth, number of secondary turns, and noise.
                <br><br>
                <b>Signal Conditioning Architecture</b>
                <br><br>
                The transducer’s secondary current is converted into a voltage using a burden resistor (R<sub>B</sub>), and then amplified using a precision instrumentation amplifier (INA849 or PGA-series). 
                Several equations are used to calculate the gain values and required external resistors to tune the input current and output voltage ranges.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                <br>
                The secondary current is used to calculate the burden voltage and required gain corresponding to each step of measured current requirement for the project. It is given by:
                <span class="equation"><strong>I<sub>S</sub> = I<sub>P</sub> &frasl; N<sub>S</sub></strong></span>
                Where I<sub>P</sub> is the primary current and N<sub>S</sub> is the number of secondary turns. To calculate the burden voltages, we must find the suggested values of the burden resistors first. These values were found by extrapolating from the datasheet of the LEM transducers. 
                For example, at an input current of 125A, the burden resistor specified by an IN 200-S transducer is around 75&#8486, while at an input of 250A, the burden resistor is required to be around 25&#8486. 
                <img src="assets/Burden Resistor Extrapolation.png" alt="Burden Resistor Extrapolation">
                Of course, these values are chosen at highest allowed operating temperature and a lower valued resistor would be able to handle higher currents and below.
                The burden voltages are then given by:
                <span class="equation"><strong>V<sub>B</sub> = I<sub>S</sub> &middot; R<sub>B</sub></strong></span>
                The burden voltage determines the amount of gain required to scale this output into the 10V full scale. 
                The required voltage gain to reach 10V FS is then calculated by:
                <span class="equation"><strong>G = 10V &frasl; V<sub>B</sub></strong></span>
                After finding the gain required for each burden resistor, the instrumentation amplifier gain resistor can then be calculated. For this project, the instrumentation amplifier chosen was the INA849 series due to its exceeding capabilities.
                The equation to calculate the gain resistor was given by the datasheet of the INA849. 
                <span class="equation"><strong>R<sub>G</sub> = 6000&#8486 &frasl; (G - 1)</strong></span>
                Finally, the power dissipation on the burden resistor must also be calculated to ensure that the resistor chosen can handle the power requirements. The power dissipation is given by:
                <span class="equation"><strong>P = I<sub>S</sub><sup>2</sup> &middot; R<sub>B</sub></strong></span>
                Now that all the required equations are declared, the journey to find the appropriate burden resistor commences. 
                Since these resistors are required to dissipate high power while having low temperature drift and low tolerance, VPG Foil Resistors were chosen for this project. 
                The process of finding the perfect range of burden resistors involved a lot of iterative calculations between the gain required and power disspation, as well as days of scouring DigiKey for the perfect resistors.
                The chosen VPG Foil resistors had a low temperature coefficient, and resulted in gain resistor values that were easily obtainable.
                The table below summarizes the final chosen burden resistors, gain resistors, and power dissipation values for each measured current step.
